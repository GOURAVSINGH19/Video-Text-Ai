For the first time in tech history, Muslim developers have a golden opportunity while others are stuck in nine to five jobs Missing prayers A small group of AI developers are building six figure halal businesses from their laptops, praying on time, working remotely, choosing their clients and serving the Ummah. I'm a developer and I recently started my own AI development agency where we build AI agents and automations for businesses. Just look at some recent projects from our agency. A $12,000 project to create automations for a Muslim Law Firm, a $3,400 project to help a YouTube DA channel with 500,000 subscribers translate their multiple languages using AI, a $6,000 project to build a voice agent for home service business, and many more halal projects that pay very well. By the end of this video, you'll have my complete system to build and launch your own one person halal AI business. This is in theory, this is the exact system that I've used to help developers like you in our community lend from two to $10,000 paid projects. This isn't just about making money, this is about reaching financial independence while staying true to our values. I'm sharing everything with you here. Strategies.
